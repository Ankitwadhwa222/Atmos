## 🛠️ How to Get Started

### 1. Fork & Clone  
- Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.  
- Clone the fork:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Atmos.git
  cd Atmos
  ```
### 2. Create a Feature Branch
-Always work in a branch separate from main:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature
```

## 3. Make Your Changes
- Implement your feature or fix in the branch.

- Keep changes focused and atomic (one concern per PR).

- Write clear code, following the existing style where possible.

### 4. Test Locally
- Run the development server and verify all features.

- Ensure no existing functionality breaks.

- If applicable, add tests (unit/integration) to cover your changes.

### 5. Commit & Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description of feature"
git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature
```


### 6. Open a Pull Request

Go to your fork on GitHub and open a PR against Open-Source-Chandigarh/Atmos:main.

Include:

- What you changed

- Why you changed it

- Screenshots or demo if UI changes

- Issue number, if fixing one (e.g. Closes #123)

### ✅ Contribution Guidelines & Best Practices

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages (e.g. fix: bug in search, feat: add dark mode).

- Keep your PRs small and scoped — easier to review and merge.

- Respect the existing code style (tabs vs spaces, naming conventions).

- Document your changes in README or appropriate docs.

- If your PR has breaking changes or migrations, mention how to upgrade.

### 🌱 Areas You Can Contribute To

- New Features / Enhancements — e.g. new views, filters, UI improvements

- Bug Fixes & Issue Resolution — check issues labeled bug or help wanted

- Testing — write unit / integration tests

- Documentation & Tutorials — improve README, user guides, code comments

- Performance / Optimization — reduce load time, memory usage, etc.

- Design & UX — improve UI, accessibility, responsiveness

### ⚡ Development Setup

- Ensure Node.js and a package manager (npm / yarn) are installed.

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```


Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```


Open your app at http://localhost:3000 (or as configured) and verify.

### 🧪 Testing Contribution

- If adding a backend or utility change, add corresponding test files.

- Use any test framework already used in the project (Jest, Mocha, etc.).

- Tests should pass locally before pushing.

- Include test coverage where relevant.

### 📌 Hacktoberfest & Friendly Contributions

- This project welcomes Hacktoberfest contributions! 🎉
